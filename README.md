# 📊 AI Companies Financial Market Analysis

This project analyzes a large dataset related to the financial market of companies involved in Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
The dataset provides a synthetic daily record (from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024) of financial market activities for major AI companies like:
OpenAI

It includes key financial metrics and major product launch events (like the launch of LLaMA by Meta, GPT by OpenAI, and Gemini by Google) that can influence stock performance.
We use Python and pandas for data analysis.
